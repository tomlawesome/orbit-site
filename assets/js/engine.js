/**
 * THE FLIGHT — one canvas engine, run UP or DOWN (#410, §15).
 *
 * Ported from design/v19/first-run.html as committed at 159ec9f, which the
 * owner ratified verbatim on 2026-08-16: "nothing short of amazing... Ship
 * these in that exact form." Every timing, curve, colour and pen in this file
 * is the mockup's own. Nothing here is a re-authoring: the profiles, the
 * bloom, the world and the frame body are the sheet's code, wrapped in a
 * factory so the module holds no globals and the unit tests can drive it.
 *
 * DOWN is not a second animation. `mirror()` maps descent time onto ascent
 * time and the speed curve, the atmosphere curve, the prop schedule and the
 * bloom are all read off the ascent through it — so the sun contracts, the
 * streaks decelerate in reverse, the limb rises back beneath you and the
 * colours return from the dark to the dawn, because that is what the climb
 * looks like run the other way. drawBloom() is ONE function, read forwards by
 * the login and backwards by the logout, exactly as the mockup reads it.
 *
 * The flight colour-matches the DEFAULT pack (star-chart) whatever pack the
 * reader is wearing — the owner's words say default theme, and the sky you are
 * climbing into is not yet yours to have chosen. If it is ever asked to wear
 * the reader's pack, PACK is the only object that changes.
