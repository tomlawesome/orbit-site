/*
 * THE DOOR, LIVE (?door3d, while it is tried): the Earth under the door drawn as it is, not as a picture.
 *
 * The same Earth the flight draws (voyage.js), from the same camera, on the same limb, so its first frame is the
 * door's picture (tools/dawn.py) and the picture can go without being seen to. Then it lives: the ground turns
 * slowly under the camera, the other way to the stars' drift over it; the clouds drift over the ground; and the sun
 * hangs at the edge of rising, a little nearer and a little further, its first light shimmering on the limb.
 *
 * Only the Earth and its air are drawn, in the band at the foot of the door they fill, over the door's own sky and
 * its glows (which stay as they are): where the Earth is, it covers them; above the limb its air is added to them.
 * One pass, no targets, a slow clock (the motion is slow: twenty frames a second carries it), and nothing at all
 * while the door is not shown. Made as chores (chores.js), after the door's painted reveal (main.js: liveDoorOf);
 * the picture stays until then.
 *
 * Drawn at the screen's own density (to 2×), and in two weights (voyage.js: sceneHead, the Earth's part alone: door,
 * so its compile does not carry the whole flight's code it never runs): the lean, the clouds a flat cover on the
 * ground; the rich, dawn.py's cloud slab. Which are compiled is chosen at the page's start by the probe
 * (capability.js: doorWeight), so only what will be drawn is: "rich", the rich alone, from the first frame, measured
 * once, drawn coarser if it must be (to half), and only if even that is over 40 ms a frame is the lean one compiled
 * and drawn instead; "lean", the lean alone (coarser if it must be), the rich never made; "both" (and without a
 * probe), the lean first, measured once after its first frame: with room to spare (16 ms a frame or less) the rich
 * one is made, measured the same way, and kept if it keeps to 40 ms (20 a second, with room), the flight then asked to
 * draw the same from the handoff on; otherwise the lean one stays, and if even that takes more than 40 ms the density
 * comes down by the square root of the excess (to half), and stays. To try them: &rich (the rich one alone, kept
 * whatever it takes; still measured), &lean (the lean one alone).
 *
 * Each measure waits for the chores to be at rest (chores.js: quiet), so it times the drawing alone, not an upload or
 * a compile beside it. Where the browser compiles on the page's own thread (COMPILES_ASIDE false), the weights chosen
 * (and with the rich one the flight's: voyage.js, compileRich) are compiled at the page's start (compileDoor), with
 * every other compile, under the first light's ring, which main.js holds until they are done (chores: "compile"), so
 * no compile ever freezes the reveal or a live loop; with "both", the rich one is still drawn only if the ladder keeps
 * it. The rich weight's two passes (the clouds' field, the cities' glow: voyage.js, cloudField, cityGlow) are drawn
 * by the rich program itself, so they are made once it is there, before its first measure.
