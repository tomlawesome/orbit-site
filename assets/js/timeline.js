/**
 * THE SEQUENCES — the wall clock of the ratified flight (#410, §15).
 *
 * Every number here is design/v19/first-run.html's own, as committed at
 * 159ec9f. The mockup wrote them as a wall of `after(ms, fn)` calls; they are
 * data here so the same list can be run live (setTimeout) or PINNED (every
 * beat up to a given millisecond applied at once), which is what makes a
 * moving thing screenshottable and unit-testable. The beats and their order
 * are not adapted — only the way they are dispatched.
 *
 *   ASCENT · wall clock from the call
 *      0     arming; the mark's centre goes white
 *      200   the canvas takes over and the flight starts
 *      260   the mark leaves the lockup and rides to centre screen (1.08s)
 *      430   the login is released
 *     1340   the mark puts itself out
 *     1560   the household's name is written on the void
 *     2600   and taken away again
 *     4800   handoff INSIDE the light — the canvas dissolves over 1.7s while
 *            the bodies condense out of it over 1.3s
 *     6400   the bare sky is readable: planets, sun, the household's name
 *     8400   two seconds later the instrument arrives (1.8s, arrive style) —
 *            v5's draw-in, slower again and on a softer curve; see T below
 *
 *   DESCENT · the ascent mirrored, in the DOM as well as on the canvas
 *      0     the instrument withdraws (arrive, reversed)
 *      620   the bodies disperse
 *      700   the canvas takes over and the reversed flight begins
 *     1000   the home surface is released
 *     2580   the household's name on the void, "signing out" beneath it
 *     3467   and taken away again
 *     3600   the dusk surface comes up under the cooling dawn
 *     3655   the mark reappears at centre and rides down to the lockup
 *     4150   the flight is over and the canvas is released
 *     5100   the mark hands back to the lockup's own glyph
 *     5350   the farewell speaks
 */

/*
 * THE OWNER'S 2026-08-16 AMENDMENT (ledger 7f7d813) trimmed the dwell 3s → 2s
 * and slowed the draw-in 1300 → 1700, curve untouched, and said as much: "if
 * v5 chose different figures, v5 wins and this table follows it."
 *
 * v5 has landed (design/v19/first-run.html at 9476480) and chose different
 * figures: the draw-in stretches again, 1700 → 1800, and this time the CURVE
 * moves too — cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.2,1) → (.2,.26,.35,1) — tuned frame by
 * frame, because a gentler curve at the same length made the wait read worse,
 * not better (a slow start is an invisible start at scale .16). The opacity
 * stop that rides along with it (60% → 55%) lives in the CSS, not here.
 * `dwell` is untouched at 2000; only `instrument` changes in this table.

 * THE NEWCOMER'S CLOCK (§15 second pass, ruling 4; the count sealed in the

 * The newcomer flies the SAME climb and sets down somewhere else, so every

 * verbatim WITH the 3s bare dwell and its tail was trimmed and sealed
 * separately after that ("the dwell before the count reduces by 1s, the beat's
 * internal rhythm unchanged"), while the 2s trim belongs to the first-run and
 * login landing. So the dwell is SPLIT rather than lowered, exactly as
 * design/v19/first-run.html splits it, and the sealed newcomer numbers are
 * where they were:
 *
 *     9400   the labelled sky's chrome arrives
 *     9700   the count fades IN on the settling sky, boxless (0.45s)
 *    12900   it fades OUT again (0.45s) — ~4.55s of screen time in all
 *    13800   and the question arrives in the space it left
 *
 * RETIMED (#870, owner): the gap before the count starts, the fade itself
 * (arrival.css's `.nf .disc` transition) and the hold all moved; the fade OUT
