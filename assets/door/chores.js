/*
 * The site's background work, done a piece at a time.
 *
 * Readying the journeys is heavy for the page: pictures put on the GPU, shaders made, frames drawn to measure the
 * machine. Done all at once it stutters whatever is moving. So each piece is a chore, queued here and done one at
 * a time (or, once a frame's share has begun, several back to back while a few ms last), the share begun in an
 * animation frame's callback, before the paint, or by a 50 ms timer if frames are late or absent (ADR-0004 6d.2), with
 * a few frames' rest after the heavy ones, and none at all until the painted part of the door's reveal is done (open). The network is not a chore: pictures are fetched (and decoded) as soon
 * as they are asked for, off the page's own thread; only what touches the page or the GPU waits its turn.
 *
 * When a journey is chosen, what that journey still needs is done straight away (hurry), a frame between each piece,
 * hidden in the journey's opening; everything else is put off until the journey is under way (the chores are
 * tagged by what they ready: "flight", "docs", "install", "info"), so nothing it does not need stalls it. The
 * measures (frames timed to fit the drawing to the machine: "measure") are never hurried, and the live door's wait
 * for the queue to be at rest (quiet) before they time anything. Where the browser compiles shaders on the page's
 * own thread (COMPILES_ASIDE false), every compile is a chore tagged "compile", and those alone may run from the
 * page's start (openCompiles), under the first light's ring, before the door is lit; the rest still wait for open.
 * A chore that promises to be frame-sized (soft: under ~5 ms, a band of a picture put on the GPU: upload.js) may run
 * sooner, from the moment the door is lit (openSoft), one a frame, during the reveal; the rest still wait for open.
