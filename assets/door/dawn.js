/*
 * The two surfaces, mounted on the host's markup (markup.js): the dawn, and its first light; the dusk.
 *
 * mountDawn(host): the star fields and the glows on the dawn's markup. start(): its pictures asked for and its glows
 * drawn, once, after the next frame is on screen (so the sky is up before the work behind it starts). light(): first
 * light, below. live: the live door (door3d.js), where the host's flag asks for it.
 *
 * FIRST LIGHT. The ring is a light running its circle (body.loading) while the dawn's first pieces come (the type,
 * the Earth's first picture), a lap at a time, each lap ending in a breath; when they have come it finishes the lap
 * it is on and goes straight into its own drawing (body.lit), and the rest comes up after it. On a first visit it
 * always runs at least a lap, and keeps on (seven at most) until what the host waits for is ready too (`wait`: the
 * site's journeys, their shaders where compiles stall the page): the host readies them the moment the dawn's pieces
 * are in (`after`), so the laps, and then the reveal, and then the time spent taking the door in, are when they
 * come. On a later visit, with everything kept, it comes straight up. It never waits for ever: seven laps, or 13 s,
 * and the door lights regardless (and without the runner's motion, under reduced motion, on the pieces alone, up
 * to 8 s).
 *
 * THE CHORES (chores.js: the GPU's share of readying what the host has queued) begin the moment the reveal's
 * painted part has finished, on every browser: what only moves or fades is carried by the compositor, and nothing on
 * the page's thread can stutter it, but what is painted (the ring's stroke drawing in, the name's blur clearing,
 * anything inside an SVG) is drawn on the page's own thread, and a chore under it stutters it. So each such
 * animation is waited for, by its own end, not by a guess. Only the soft chores (a band of a picture put on the
 * GPU, under ~5 ms: upload.js) run during the reveal, one a frame, from the moment the door is lit (openSoft; not
 * with the holdreveal flag); and the reveal's longest gap between two frames is said with them when it ends (the
 * proof it stayed smooth: 16.7 ms is a whole frame at 60 Hz). Where compiles are in the background (`aside`), every
 * chore runs from the moment the door is lit, not from the reveal's end (chosen by eye on the laptop in Edge,
 * 8 October, against the held reveal and the two ring endings; the open=late flag holds them to the reveal's end,
 * to compare). Where a compile stalls the page (Firefox), held as before. To see, each at its own address: ring=stop,
 * the ring ends the moment the work is done and the drawn ring takes over from where the runner is; ring=rush, the
 * runner speeds up (x3) to finish its lap within about half a second.
