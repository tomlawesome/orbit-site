/*
 * WHETHER THIS PAGE MAY USE THE GPU, AND WHETHER THIS MACHINE CAN DRAW THE FLIGHT'S WORLD (ADR-0002, #2; Orbit's
 * #1253). Ported from Orbit's web/src/lib/flight/fitness.js. The fitness test runs every visit, so a driver fix, a new
 * GPU or a busy moment is judged as it is now; its verdict is also kept on the device for a week (ADR-0002 6.4, owner
 * 19a, #116), so a later visit's ways in can open on a remembered pass while the test is taken again quietly.
 *
 * Two questions, asked at different times:
 *  - gpu(): once a page, before any other WebGL, from ONE context. Refused where the browser itself calls WebGL2 a
 *    major performance caveat, and where the renderer is software (llvmpipe, softpipe, SwiftShader, Microsoft Basic
 *    Render): such a machine draws without WebGL and nothing else on the page touches the GPU. Accepted, the context
 *    is kept and handed to the flight's world (voyage.js) and the probe (capability.js), so the page never makes a
 *    second one for them.
 *  - frameCost(): whole frames, timed with the GPU made to finish each, against a budget that leaves room for about
 *    30 frames a second. Asked only when a flight proves its world (voyage.js), never on the door.
 *
 * WARM FIRST, THEN THE MEDIAN. The first frames at a new size carry the driver's last shader work, the pictures'
 * upload and the render targets' allocation; on Firefox (ANGLE, no parallel compile) that alone is past the budget on
 * a real GPU. So a couple of frames are drawn untimed first, and then a few are timed one by one and judged on their
 * median: one hitch is not a slow machine. It stops as soon as most of the timed frames have agreed.
