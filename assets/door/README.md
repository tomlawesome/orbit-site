# The shared door

The Earth door and the flight that open both the site and Orbit's sign-in:
the dawn, the launch, the bare sky, and the dusk to leave by, with their
engine, their timeline, the live Earth and the pictures they draw. This
folder is the one copy (ADR-0001, `docs/adr/0001-the-door-is-shared-with-orbit.md`):
it lives on the site, and Orbit's own job copies it from the site's `main`
unchanged and opens a merge request there. A change the door needs is made
here; Orbit never edits its copy.

It is self-contained: nothing in it imports from outside the folder, reads
the page's address, or makes a URL from its own location. The site's lint
holds it to that (`tools/ci/lint.sh`, "the shared door is self-contained").

## Licence

This folder is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or
later (Orbit's licence) as well as under the site's own licence
(`LICENSE` at the repository root, section 3). Take it under either. The
imagery under `img/` is NASA's, in the public domain, credited in the root
`README.md`.

## The interface

`index.js` is the only file a host imports. Its entry point and its settings
are an interface between two repositories: change them deliberately, because
a break shows in Orbit's import merge request, not in the site's gate.

```js
import { createDoor } from "./assets/door/index.js";
const door = createDoor({
  image: (path) => `assets/door/img/${path}`,   // where a picture is; see Settings
  flags: {},                                     // the debug switches, read by the host
});
const dawn = door.dawn(document.querySelector("#door"));
const dusk = door.dusk(document.querySelector("#dusk"));
const journey = door.journey({ canvas, name, dawnGlyph, duskGlyph, on: { dusk, farewell } });
```

### Settings (`settings.js`)

| Setting | What | Site | Orbit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image(path)` | Where a picture is: `"dawn/dawn.webp"` → a URL the page can load. Never built from `import.meta.url`: in a Vite build that leaks file paths into server-rendered pages and does not resolve in the browser | a relative base | its own map, `import.meta.glob(..., { query: "?url" })` |
| `flags` | The debug switches: `door3d`, `rich`, `lean`, `level` (`"0"`–`"2"`), `holdreveal`, `mainthread`, `ring` (`"stop"`/`"rush"`), `open` (`"late"`). The folder never reads the address; the host does | from `location.search` | none |
| `storagePrefix` | The first word of every localStorage key the folder writes (`orbit-probe …`) | `orbit` | `orbit` |
| `settle` | `timeline.js`: ms after the landing at which the instrument arrives (the site's own amendment, 2026-10) | 1100 | 1100 |
| `typingWait` | `chores.js`: an unhurried chore waits while someone is typing, this long after the last key; 0 never waits (Orbit's addition) | 600 | 600 |

### The dawn: `door.dawn(host)` → `{ start, light, live, world, host }`

`host` is the `#door` element rendered from `dawnMarkup`. Mounting draws the
star fields and sets the glows' origin.

- `start()`: the Earth's pictures asked for and the glows drawn, once, after
  the next frame is on screen. Call it whenever the door is shown.
- `light({ firstVisit, wait, after, onLit, onOpen, aside })`: first light,
  once per showing. The ring runs while the door's pieces (the fonts, the
  Earth's first picture) come; `firstVisit` makes it run at least a lap;
  `wait` makes it run on until the promise `after()` returns has settled
  (the host caps that promise). `after()` is called once the ring is up and
  running: the host readies what it has to. `onLit()`: `body.lit` is set and
  the reveal begins. `onOpen()`: the chores are open (`openChores` has been
  called); the host may start what waits for them. `aside`: whether shader
  compiles here are in the background (`compilesAside()` unless the host
  says). The flags `ring` and `open` apply here.
- `live`: the live door (`door3d.js`), only where `flags.door3d` is set,
  else `null`: `compile()`, `start()` → the live door, `measured` (a promise:
  it has been measured and shown), `firstCompiled()`.

### The dusk: `door.dusk(host)` → `{ start, world, host }`

`start()`: the dusk's pictures decoded ahead of the beat that shows them
(`decode-ahead.js`), its glows' origin set. Call it when the sign-out begins.

### The journey: `door.journey({ canvas, name, dawnGlyph, duskGlyph, on })`

`canvas` is `#warp`, `name` is `#launchname`, the glyphs are functions
returning the two lockups' SVGs. Returns `{ fly, ascend, descend, reset,
reduced, warm, warmDocs, compiled }`.

- `fly(profile, { title, subtitle, ready, on })`: the climb, `profile` a
  flight profile (`UP`, or one made from it: the site's `assets/js/journeys.js`);
  `ready`, a promise the clock holds for just before the canvas comes up, at
  most eight seconds. Hooks, each optional, in order: `release` (the surface
  flown from may go), `land` (the bare sky is readable), `settled` (the
  instrument has arrived).
- `descend({ title, subtitle, onto, from, on })`: the descent, `onto`
  `"dusk"` or `"dawn"`, `from` the profile flown up (mirrored on the way
  down). Hooks: `released`, `surface` (the dusk or the dawn comes up),
  `farewell`.
- `on` given to `journey()` holds the defaults: `release`, `land`,
  `settled`, `released`, `dusk` (the descent's surface), `farewell`.
- `warm()`: the flight's world made ready; `warmDocs()`: and the galaxy;
  `compiled()`: its shaders compiled. `reset()`: everything off.

The journey sets body classes the stylesheet answers: `arming`, `showdawn`,
`showwarp`, `launching`, `bare`, `instrument`, `withdrawing`, `dispersing`,
`showdusk`, `farewell`, `holding`. The host's surfaces style themselves on
them.

### Markup (`markup.js`)

`dawnMarkup({ image, lockup, gate, foot, indent })` and
`duskMarkup({ image, gate, foot, farewell, indent })` are pure string
functions: the door's markup with the host's parts in the slots (`lockup`,
between the glyph and the name; `gate`, inside `.gate-wrap`; `foot`, at the
surface's foot). The site writes them into `index.html` with
`node tools/door-markup.mjs` (the lint fails if the page differs); Orbit
renders them in its components. `image` is the same resolver as the setting.

### Stylesheet (`door.css`)

Loaded before the host's own sheet. Its header lists what it asks of the
host (`--star-far`, `--star-near`, `--display`, `--mono`, `html.rich`) and
the keyframes it defines that a host may use (`driftf`, `driftn`,
`spinback`). Every `url()` in it stays inside the folder.

### Also exported from `index.js`

For a host's own worlds and skies, so their work takes its turn with the
door's: the chores (`chore`, `fetchOnce`, `openChores`, `hurryChores`,
`note`, `quiet`, `compilesAside`, …), `uploadBanded`, the capability probe
(`probe`, `level`, `liveDoor`, `lateDoor`), `seededRng`, `el`,
`measureTile`, the engine (`createFlight`, `UP`, `PROPS_UP`, `UPDUR`), the
glows' graphs (`DAWN`, `DUSK`) and `decodeAhead`.
